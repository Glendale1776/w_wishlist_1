## Implemented
- Added admin moderation in-memory domain with report queue, stale-claim override, aggregate recalculation, and immutable audit events.
- Added guarded admin APIs for queue reads, report hide/unhide actions, and claim override with required reason validation.
- Added `/app/admin/moderation` UI with admin-only gate, queue filters, detail actions, stale claim overrides, audit feed, and action toasts.
- Added `scripts/tests/s07-admin-smoke.mjs` to verify role guard and audit persistence flows against a running app.
- Marked `S-07` done and moved it from `docs/slices/pending/` to `docs/slices/done/`.

## Validation
- npm run typecheck: failed (`tsc: command not found`) because dependencies are not installed.
- npm run build: failed (`next: command not found`) because dependencies are not installed.
