## Implemented
- Added public share route app/w/[shareToken]/page.tsx with server-side token lookup and metadata generation.
- Added client UI app/w/[shareToken]/public-share-client.tsx with item feed, deep-link modal, and auth-gated Reserve/Contribute paths.
- Added loading skeletons, retryable error card, and live in-page update simulation for reservation/funding state.
- Added canonical, OpenGraph/Twitter metadata, and robots noindex on the share route.
- Updated auth flow form behavior to preserve return-to context for gated actions.
- Added APP_BASE_URL to .env.example.
- Marked S-03 done and moved it to docs/slices/done/.
