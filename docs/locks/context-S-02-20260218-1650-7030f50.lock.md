## Implemented
- Added Next.js App Router owner flows for /auth, /app, /app/lists, /app/lists/new, and /app/lists/[wishlistId] via app/app/[[...slug]]/page.tsx.
- Added first-run onboarding with removable sample items and create-first-wishlist CTA.
- Added owner list index with deterministic share-link copy feedback.
- Added owner wishlist editor with URL/manual modes, group-fund target validation, archive action, and hard-delete block when history exists.
- Added minimal Next.js 15 + TypeScript + Tailwind project setup files.
- Marked S-02 done and moved it to docs/slices/done/.

## Validation
